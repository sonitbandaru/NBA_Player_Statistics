# NBA_Player_Statistics

In this project, I analyzed NBA player statistics from the 2020-2021 season with a dataset from Kaggle.com. I made a series of bar charts and box plots showcasing players statistics per game.These visualizations showed comparisons among top players in various statistical categories and distributions of the data. I fitted a linear regression model with several statistics as predictors. This model revealed the impact of these statistics on player MPG, providing insights for player management strategies. I also plotted residuals which showed that the model was fairly evenly distributed. Overall, I used my skills in data analysis, statistical modeling, and visualization techniques to derive meaningful insights from the NBA season.
